What is Merklenet?

Blockchain Publisher

Merkle is a blockchain content publisher. We are using the alpha version application of what will be available to the world as we progress. The application or protocol machine allows for: Encrypted Private Messages, Decentralized Data Storage, Cross Chain Links, Website Hosting on Chain, and NFT sales and mints from your own “store front”

Data — Decentralized Storage

Merkle Token Inc. uses the existing blockchain networks of Bitcoin, Testnets, and forks of BTC to host your data. Cost for hosting data will depend on the chain you wish to store data. Some are free after initial publishing costs.

WEB3-Publishing

Not all users will want to use the application for publishing content many will use the dApp simply for “surfing the Blockchain”. As a first Publisher on numerous blockchains Merkle is setting an example for trusted content and building a network of content creators that want their creations hosted on chain.

Website hosting

Websites can be hosted on chain for very little cost. The dApp will allow any user to publish their own website by simply clicking the “etch” button. Creating a website that can be browsed offline is also a possibility and feel free to contact our team about building your site this way.

NFT Image Data | Personal Store Front

The dApp we are working to build with nonprofit programmers will give everyone the power of Opensea. Except your NFT will actually be immutable. Personalized store fronts and peer2peer sales and auctions will be available.

Cross Chain Linking

We can publish content understanding that not all data is needed to persist indefinitely while other data could benefit from permanence. Domain names for example can be created on production networks while websites themselves would be hosted on non production networks. The dApp then connects the two networks and allows them to function together.

Encrypted Private Messaging and Vaults

Merkle has been able to send and receive encrypted private messages in the alpha version of the dApp. The encryption is blockchain encryption and bullet proof. The data vaults are also encrypted and hosted on chain. Only those with the digital keys have access.
